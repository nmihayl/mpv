# hellio's mpv config

![screenshot](image.jpg)

This repository hosts my personal mpv configuration alongside the scripts I use, making this config very easy to deploy. It is mainly written for GNU/Linux, however I also maintain it for Windows compatibility.

## Requirements

- mpv (version >0.38)
- ffmpeg
- yt-dlp

On Windows, I advise installing the packages via Chocolatey. Otherwise use your preferred *nix package manager.

## General outline

This configurations is keyboard-centric, therefore I highly advise you check `input.conf` and edit the keybinds if you feel inclined to do so. You can refer to the keybinds at any time in mpv with the shortcut `Ctrl+h`.

As this is made for mpv version 0.38 which adds the context menu on Windows, the keybindings also include appropriate context menu entries as displayed in the screenshot.
